        "\n",
        "This notebook is hosted on Google Colab. To be able to work on it, you have to create your own copy. Go to *File* and select *Save a copy in Drive*.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also avoid using Colab entirely, and download the notebook to run it on your own machine. If you choose this, go to *File* and select *Download .ipynb*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this assignment with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is very valuable because for many interesting models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",

        "```sh\n",
        "!nvidia-smi\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that despite the name, Google Colab does  not support collaborative work without issues. When two or more people edit the notebook concurrently, only one version will be saved. You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission:** Upload your notebook in .ipynb format to Canvas. The code and answers to the questions in the notebook are sufficient, no separate report is expected. "

        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">The graph convolution operation in a GCN operates by propagating feature vectors across the graph because it uses the adjacency matrix, which encodes the connections between nodes in the graph, to weight the contribution of each node's feature vector to the updated representations of its neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">The adjacency matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ is a square matrix where n is the number of nodes in the graph. Each element $A_{ij}$ in the matrix represents the strength of the connection between nodes i and j. If there is no connection between the two nodes, the value of $A_{ij}$ is 0. If there is a connection, the value is 1 (for an weighted graph it can also be a real number).\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">The degree matrix $D\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ is a diagonal matrix where the value of each element $D_{ii}$ is the degree of the node $i$, i.e., the number of connections it has to other nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">In the GCN formula, the adjacency matrix is first transformed into $\\tilde{A}$ by adding the identity matrix $I_n$ to it. This has the effect of adding self-loops to all the nodes, i.e., connections from each node to itself with weight 1. This is done to ensure that each node's own feature vector is taken into account when updating its representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">The degree matrix $\\tilde{D}$ is then computed from the modified adjacency matrix $\\tilde{A}$. The matrix $\\tilde{A}$ is then element-wise multiplied by the inverse of $\\tilde{D}$, resulting in the matrix $\\hat{A}$. This matrix is used to weight the contribution of each node's feature vector to the updated representation of its neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">Finally, the feature vectors $X$ are multiplied by the matrix of parameters $W$ to obtain the updated representations $Z$. The resulting matrix $Z$ contains the updated feature vectors for all the nodes in the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">In this way, the GCN formula propagates the feature vectors of the nodes across the graph, using the adjacency matrix to weight the contribution of each node's feature vector to its neighbors' updated representations."

        "*Answer*\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">In the \"Semi-supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks\" paper, the authors use a number of citation network datasets to evaluate their GCN model. These datasets consist of nodes representing papers and edges representing citations between papers. The nodes are labeled with the subject area of the paper, and the task is to predict the subject area of each node based on the labels of the other nodes and the structure of the citation network.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* *What makes this problem semi-supervised?*\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">The problem is considered semi-supervised because only a portion of the nodes in the dataset are labeled, while the rest of the nodes are unlabeled. The GCN model is trained to predict the labels of the unlabeled nodes based on the labels of the labeled nodes and the structure of the citation network. This is in contrast to a supervised learning problem, in which all the training data is labeled, or an unsupervised learning problem, in which all the data is unlabeled.\n",
        "\n",
        "* *What is the proportion of labeled data used for training with respect to labeled data in the validation and test sets?*\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">In the experiments reported in the paper, the authors use a fixed amount of labeled data for training and evaluate the model on a fixed amount of labeled data in the validation and test sets. The proportion of labeled data used for training varies across the different datasets, but in general it is relatively small compared to the total amount of data. For example, in the Cora dataset, the authors use 140 labeled data points for training, 500 labeled data points for validation, and 1,000 labeled data points for testing. This is a small fraction of the total number of data points in the dataset, which is around 2,500.\n",
        "\n",
        "* *What is difference in this context with other benchmark tasks in machine learning, like image classification with MNIST?*\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">The use of a relatively small amount of labeled data for training is common in semi-supervised learning, as it is often the case that only a small amount of labeled data is available. In contrast, in tasks like image classification with MNIST, a much larger proportion of the data is typically used for training. For example, the MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, so the proportion of labeled data used for training is much higher.\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Why do you think the GCN performs well in this semi-supervised scenario?*\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">There are several reasons why the GCN model introduced in the \"Semi-supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks\" paper performs well in a semi-supervised classification scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">First, the GCN model is specifically designed to make use of both labeled and unlabeled data in a graph structure. It uses the graph structure and the labels of the labeled nodes to propagate information and make predictions for the unlabeled nodes. This allows it to make use of additional information about the relationships between the data points, which can improve the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">Second, the GCN model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which has been shown to be effective for many types of data, including images and text. The GCN model extends the CNN architecture to graph-structured data by using graph convolutional layers, which can effectively capture local patterns and dependencies in the graph structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">Finally, the GCN model is trained using a variant of the cross-entropy loss function, which is a common choice for classification tasks. This loss function allows the model to learn to predict the correct class labels for the data points based on the input features and the labels of the labeled data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">Overall, the combination of these factors makes the GCN model well-suited to solving semi-supervised classification problems on graph-structured data."
